Let G be a directed and fully connected graph.
Let MAX be the size of groups.
Until G is a completely disconnected graph:

	//Find new group connections.
	For every node S in G:
		Let V be a list of edges of S.
		For every node N connected to S through edge E:
			If N is NOT busy AND N is hosting fewer than MAX:
				If N is not hosting N:
					N hosts N.
				N hosts S.
				S is busy.
				Remove E.

	//Find unassigned duplicate connections.
	For every node S in G:
		If S is not busy AND S is not hosting S:
			For every node N in G:
				If N is NOT busy:
					N hosts S.

	//Output groups for this week.
	Output current week.
	Increment week.
	For every node S in G:
		If S is hosting S:
			Output S guest list.
